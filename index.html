                        <p class="me">A 23 year old girl who thought taking a web developing class would be easy.She soon found out that front-end coding is more complexed than it seems. She still had a good time learning since there were no dull moments.  </p>
                        <h2>Long Story </h2>
                        <p class="me">I was born in Huehuetenango, Guatemala and immigrated in the US at an early age. Although I love my country, I do acknowledge California is pretty amazing. The state doesn't only have amazing weather but it has pretty diverse. Some work places might not examplify the diversity but Bitwise is breaking that norm. I decided to take this class for fun. Although I knew the class was not going to be easy, I was still surprised at all the challenges that were presented in class. Overall, I am greatful that I was part of this cohort since I got to meet some amazing people and gained new skills.

                   <h5>Day of Dead</h5>
                   <h8 class="me">(My favorite holiday)</h8>
                    <p class="me">
                        The celebration begins with a ceremony at the cemetery, where the elders and the cofrades or brotherhood leaders invoke the souls of the dead. On October 31st, they serenade their loved ones who have passed away, offering them food and flowers. That same evening, horsemen prepare for the “Skack Koyl” (wild horse race), dancing and drinking alcoholic beverages. The competition takes place on November 1st, when some of the horsemen literally fall from their horses. The feast is followed by the music and the staging of the Danza de la Conquista dance. On November 2, day of the dead, they say farewell to their ancestors.
